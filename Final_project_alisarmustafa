#Outline

# Summary: In this project I will be comparing misconduct categories and consequences of misconduct between majority White schools in Allegheny County and majority Black schools in Allegheny County in the 2018-2019 school calendar year.

# Structure:

First I want to identify 5-10 schools who are majority Black and 5-10 schools who are majority white in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh PA. I will start with 5 and if that is not enough data I will add more schools.
The story would begin with the different demographics of the school districts I use. I would like to start by asking a question such as “ Are Pittsburgh Schools Segregated?”or “ How does the segregation of Pittsburgh Schools affect the outcomes of involvement of local law enforcement?” (I’m still workshopping this).  As per the advice of the Good Charts Book I will deconstruct and reconstruct the charts I want to show to tell the story. First I will show the demographics of the different School Districts I choose. I will do this to make sure that people understand that I am trying to compare these schools by Race.
Second I will tell the story of misconduct categories split in two different charts. One chart would represent the majority Black School District misconduct category and another chart would represent the majority White School District misconduct category. This deconstruction of the charts would help the audience understand the step by step process of the story. 
The book suggests telling a sequential visual story so I am thinking of using a White student and a Black student and telling their story as they go to their prospective schools to make the story more engaging and personal and develop a connection between the audience and the issue at hand.
Now I would like to show the result of misconduct per school district type. I want to show two charts. One chart outlining discipline by race for majority white schools and another showing discipline by race for majority black students.
The next two chart comparisons would show incidents involving local law enforcement. 
Then I would like to show this data adjusted to the demographic population of each school district. Here I am thinking of using animation to show the charts changing slowly as I adjust for population size. 
Finally I would like to put out a call to action to stop the involvement of local law enforcement and not have suspensions for non-violent misconducts.

# The Data:

Link to the data source: https://www.safeschools.pa.gov/Main.aspx?App=6a935f44-7cbf-45e1-850b-e29b2f1ff17f&Menu=dbd39a1f-3319-4a75-8f69-d1166dba5d70&res&fbclid=IwAR1kx--H7314n0PXinV5g3HMR8-R9zcV4mPl7i8UfeijKKRg5E5weK7Khc0

My data source is the Pennsylvania Safe Schools Department of Education Reports. The reports include reports by county, public school/district, charter, intermediate unit, vo-tech, non-public and by year. I will use the public school/district report. I will choose the top 5 schools who are majority white and the top 5 schools that are majority Black. When analyzing each school I will be looking at data on enrollment, misconduct categories, total arrests, offenders by race, and incidents involving local law enforcement. I am thinking of aggregating the misconduct categories between violent and non-violent or use a hierarchical method of aggregating it. 

# Method and Medium:

I will use a combination of Canva, tableau and personal digital illustrations to build my story. I am thinking of using Canva for the structure and color palettes. I will use tableau to build the basic charts and my personal illustrations to create figures of people and drawings as needed. I want to create vector figures of people to make it more personal. I might actually create an ArcGIS map to illustrate some location based data. For example to show how schools are still segregated.
