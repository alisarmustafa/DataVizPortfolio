# About me
Hello everyone!! My name is Alisar Mustafa, my pronouns are she/her or they/them. I am in the MSPPM Flagship Program. I was born and raised in Syria and moved to Austria at the age of 14 where I lived for two years before moving to Berkeley, California at the age of 16. I went to San Francisco State University where I majored in Political Science and minored in Middle East and Islamic Studies. I am interested in learning how to bridge the policy and activism worlds since they are very disconnected from eachother. I believe learning data visualization is a helpful tool to make policy more accessible to people. 

I come from a deep rooted advocacy and activism background that started with my grandfather running away from Syria to Lebanon then escaping Lebanon during the civil war and my father being a political prisoner for 14 years in Syria for defying the Syrian government. After leaving Syria and seeing the outstanding amount of Syrians escapign and living in Refugee Camps, I felt pretty helpless on how to help until I realized that educatin is the first and most powerful step and tool to give people in refugee camps since it was impossible to help anyone inside of Syria. That is where my passion for education policy originated. I worked on a successful bi-annual Hearts for Syria fundraiser event to raise awareness and funds for UNHCR. I also worked closely with UNHCR on the issue. I also taught at San Francisco International School which is a public school for children who have been in the United States for four years or less. Because there is a disconnect between Policy Makers and workers on the ground I wanted to teach in these schools and learn the struggles that they go through before making policies that affects them. After I graduate I hope to work on managing projects that affect education for children in refugee camps or Immigration Detention Centers.

# What I hope to learn
 I would like to use this class to learn how to make data accessible for people who are not aware of the issues. I would also like to use this class so I can learn how to accurately and critically create visualizations for Education Policy proposals and give updates on how the specific projects are affecting the population. I hope to learn creative ways to convey data beyond simple charts.

# General Government Debt
General government debt-to-GDP ratio measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP. It is a key indicator for the sustainability of government finance. Debt is calculated as the sum of the following liability categories (as applicable): currency and deposits; debt securities, loans; insurance, pensions and standardised guarantee schemes, and other accounts payable. Changes in government debt over time primarily reflect the impact of past government deficits.
