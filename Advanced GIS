# What I hope to Learn: 
I hope to learn how to make GIS accessible and easier to understand. How to make it nice to look at. I struggle with colors ALOT so anything in that arena is super helpful. I would like to learn how to make maps look clean and minimal. I am excited to learn about all the different tools we will be using. I am also interested in how we can minimize bias when creating maps and the data we use. What should we be looking for? How do we minimize bias? Super excited about the ethics part of GIS. I am also interested in how to fit a map into a general story telling of a data story. So how would a GIS map fit and when is it most effective to use vs. a bar chart etc?
