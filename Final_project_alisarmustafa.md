# Outline

# Summary: 
In this project I will be comparing misconduct categories and consequences of misconduct between majority White schools in Allegheny County and majority Black schools in Allegheny County in the 2018-2019 school calendar year.

# Structure:

First I want to identify 5-10 schools who are majority Black and 5-10 schools who are majority white in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh PA. I will start with 5 and if that is not enough data I will add more schools.
The story would begin with the different demographics of the school districts I use. I would like to start by asking a question such as “ Are Pittsburgh Schools Segregated?”or “ How does the segregation of Pittsburgh Schools affect the outcomes of involvement of local law enforcement?” (I’m still workshopping this).  As per the advice of the Good Charts Book I will deconstruct and reconstruct the charts I want to show to tell the story. First I will show the demographics of the different School Districts I choose. I will do this to make sure that people understand that I am trying to compare these schools by Race.
Second I will tell the story of misconduct categories split in two different charts. One chart would represent the majority Black School District misconduct category and another chart would represent the majority White School District misconduct category. This deconstruction of the charts would help the audience understand the step by step process of the story. 
The book suggests telling a sequential visual story so I am thinking of using a White student and a Black student and telling their story as they go to their prospective schools to make the story more engaging and personal and develop a connection between the audience and the issue at hand.
Now I would like to show the result of misconduct per school district type. I want to show two charts. One chart outlining discipline by race for majority white schools and another showing discipline by race for majority black students.
The next two chart comparisons would show incidents involving local law enforcement. 
Then I would like to show this data adjusted to the demographic population of each school district. Here I am thinking of using animation to show the charts changing slowly as I adjust for population size. 
Finally I would like to put out a call to action to stop the involvement of local law enforcement and not have suspensions for non-violent misconducts.

# The Data:

Link to the data source: https://www.safeschools.pa.gov/Main.aspx?App=6a935f44-7cbf-45e1-850b-e29b2f1ff17f&Menu=dbd39a1f-3319-4a75-8f69-d1166dba5d70&res&fbclid=IwAR1kx--H7314n0PXinV5g3HMR8-R9zcV4mPl7i8UfeijKKRg5E5weK7Khc0

My data source is the Pennsylvania Safe Schools Department of Education Reports. The reports include reports by county, public school/district, charter, intermediate unit, vo-tech, non-public and by year. I will use the public school/district report. I will choose the top 5 schools who are majority white and the top 5 schools that are majority Black. When analyzing each school I will be looking at data on enrollment, misconduct categories, total arrests, offenders by race, and incidents involving local law enforcement. I am thinking of aggregating the misconduct categories between violent and non-violent or use a hierarchical method of aggregating it. 

# Method and Medium:

I will use a combination of Canva, tableau and personal digital illustrations to build my story. I am thinking of using Canva for the structure and color palettes. I will use tableau to build the basic charts and my personal illustrations to create figures of people and drawings as needed. I want to create vector figures of people to make it more personal. I might actually create an ArcGIS map to illustrate some location based data. For example to show how schools are still segregated.

# User Research Protocol:
The target audience I hope to reach with my story are people who can lobby their representatives to end over-suspensions and expulsions of Black students for non-violent crimes. For my interviews I decided to interview two people who are heavily involved with organizations that work on this issue, two people who don't have much knowledge on the issue and are not from or live in Pittsburgh to see if I can connect to them. One person who is knowledgable about chart making. One person who has gone through Allegheny County school system. 
## Questions for Feedback:
Can you tell me what you think this is?
Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
 Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
 Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Is there anything you would change or do differently?

## Changes for next week:
I will include data sources and how I did my calculations. Include a page on my calculation and research methods. Include data table I created for reference. Maybe not for next week since I don't think I'll have enough time but for the final product I will be creating the Samira/Alex personas myself rather than the Canva ones. I will work on alignments and edit the blur out of the pictures. Also need to make fonts bigger for legends. I will make them color blind friendly. I will work on a visual representation for my 8th slide. I need to work on making my labels clearer or are a bit more description to my labels. I will work on my call to action to make it more concise and specific. I need to make a connection back to the personas at the end of the presentation. 

# Feedback:

## Feedback #1:
The suspension Rates by race adjusted to the offender population is confusing of what it is trying to say. 
In the expulsion rate by race the focus is meant to be on Mount Lebanon, which has a super high expulsion rate across both races. I also notice that there are other schools with lower expulsion rates but they are predominantly black. I think would be great to add a more descriptive headline to really direct the reader's attention
Define “mostly white and mostly black school” I don't know if that's too specific but I think it would be helpful in framing this conversation

## Feedback#2:
I feel like your figures are difficult to misinterpret because the titles tell you exactly what you’re looking at. There’s a few that I couldn’t figure out, and I made that clear when I comment on each of the figures below. 
I was expecting more racial discrepancies to pop out visually… I guess the data is too messy to show a clear racial bias in all of the figures
Audience is Educators, parents, decision-makers, school police, any member of the general public interested in education 
-          I’m not sure I like the choice of colors since RG colorblind is a thing… here’s a website I use to help suggest color palettes: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3
-          I would probably do black for black people and light gray for white people.
Demographics of Offenders in Allegheny County High School:
-          I like this one too. I think you want to keep the color scheme for this one the same as in the previous one. If green is Black people, then it should always be black people. It’s confusing to look at this one and the last one and realize the label flips
-          Why a semi-circle? I don’t mind, but just curious
    Nice job including the %s alongside the graph.  
Incidents involving local law enforcement vs. total arrests:
-          This image needs to include what the gray areas are
-          I wish I had some way of knowing what the total arrests and total incidents are… it’s hard to tell with these slices how much larger one is than the other 
Suspension Rates by Race
 I’m confused by this figure because:
 I’m not sure what a suspension rate is
  I’m not sure what the offender population per race is (I know we talked about it, but no else knows what it means) 
 I would look for a more intuitive way to describe what you’re saying so that any reader can understand what the words mean
It might help to add text to the y-axis, even going as far as showing the mathematical formula so someone can see how it’s calculated
  I might try “Ratio of suspensions to offenders by race and by school”
  I also don’t like that this is a stacked bar plot. I think it’ll be interesting to compare the height of the black bar to the height of the white bar for each school. I realize you’re super crammed for space, but maybe you can justify that by doing a two panel plot where the first panel shows the first half and the second panel shows the second half. It’ll look ugly but will also convey the information better
Top 5 Black/ White Schools total arrests 
I think the figure you have after that does a better job communicating what this figure it trying to communicate 
Total Arrests of students by Race
 I like this figure more than the previous figure… and the information presented here almost supercedes what the previous figure was showing
 I would find a way to add the schools to the y-axis
 
## Feedback #3:
Incidents involving local law enforcements vs. total arrests:
I had some trouble interpreting this one
Is it that the inner circle is % of arrests given the cases that involve law enforcement?
Top 5 Black/White schools total arrests 
Some clarification on the graph title would be helpful! I had trouble understanding what top 5 Black schools meant here, and then total arrests on top of that
Would be helpful in general to include % in numbers for pie charts and disc-type charts I think! It's harder to read percentage from those
might be helpful to change color scheme just a little, so that folx with red-green color blindness can also see the graphics! (Blue-yellow color blindness is another one to avoid for graphics)
wasn't sure if you had an order to the schools listed on the x-axis, but if not, then it might be a good idea/might be helpful to order the schools in decreasing order of total arrests or expulsions

## Feedback #4:
For demographics change title to “High Schools in Allegheny County” and off to the side put the total number of schools 
Arrests vs. local enforcement 
 I found this one only slightly unhelpful, maybe put the red part on the overall green/grey circle, otherwise it is difficult to tell how many arrests there are 
 can you put all of the schools that have data we can see next to each other, then have all the other schools without much data at the end?
change title to “ top 5 predominantly Xrace schools total arrests of Xrace students” 
I think this would be for some school board or diversity team connected to the city trying to get a handle on what is happening in the schools here. It is refreshing to see that the data shows the discrimination that is happening so clearly. This could easily be put together in a report and be very useful to a lot of folks.
## Feedback #5:
. My immediate reaction was that this was supposed to prove a point about school punishment by race and the inequality that comes with it. Some of them I found to be a little confusing, maybe because of my minimal ability to read graphs, or by its design, or from not knowing the county's context. For example, image 3, 5, 6, and 8, I would especially need help better understanding. 
This is telling me that Black students are punished disproportionately to white students. 
I think this is intended for policy makers and leaders in the Allegheny County community. 
Some of your syntax can be improved, like in img 7. And img 8 looks like its missing units. In general, it looks like aesthetically and visually the graphs are affective, but they need more words around them to make them better to understand. 

## Feedback #6:
I think the general theme is about racism and policing, especially with relation to police officers in schools. The data shows the disproportionate criminalization of Black students.
The titles are self-explanatory on most of them. I am confused by the first graph, "incidents involving local law enforcements vs total arrests". I get that the green part of the outer circle represents incidents involving local law enforcement and the red part of the inner circle represents total arrests. But i don't understand what each circle itself represents. Like, I can tell that roughly like 80% of the outer circle represents incidents involving local law enforcement, but I don't know what that means because I don't understand the circle.  I am guessing that this is related to schools, but it took me a while to figure that out—I wish it was stated more clearly.
I have trouble with the second one too "incarceration rates by race..." — I don't get why the white and black stats are stacked on top of each other. The same goes for the last graph about expulsion rate.
For the 3rd 4th and 5th ones that talk about demographics of offenders, arrests, suspensions, and students in Allegheny Co high schools—i get it. But also, I'm confused—are all of the students in allegheny county high schools either white or black?? because that's what it looks like, but that can't possibly be true.
When you say "top 5 Black schools" and "top 5 white schools" in the 6th graph—I don't totally get what that means. Top 5 in what? Top 5 with the most white students? 
The 7th graph "Total Arrests of Students by Race" has no labels on the Y axis and so I don't get what it's telling me.
Unfortunately I'm not surprised by the criminalization of Black students, tho i am saddened
Audience: probably school administrators and members of the public. It would help inform them 

# Similarities: 
The chart Incidents involving local law enforcements vs. total arrests is confusing to everyone so I might separate them into two charts for Part III
Titles are confusing so I changed them to Predominantly Black/White schools
Almost everyone liked that I put percentages by the bar graphs 
# Differences:
Everyone except one person who gave feedback thought the Total Arrests of students by Race is confusing so I ended up deleting it and doing something different. 
Audience is different depending on the background of the person giving feedback
# Thoughts:
Feedback #2 is from someone who has heavy experience in making and reading chart so their feedback was very different since they could understand it more than the rest which made me realize that my charts are not very accessible to those not familiar with reading charts and not familiar with the subject
I worked on decluttering my charts as much as I can after the feedback was given to make it easier to read
My favorite piece of feedback is putting schools who have expulsions in a different graph rather than including ALL schools since only 8 schools had expulsions. This made my graphs clearer.
