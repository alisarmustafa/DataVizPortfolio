# Outline

# Summary: 
In this project I will be comparing misconduct categories and consequences of misconduct between majority White schools in Allegheny County and majority Black schools in Allegheny County in the 2018-2019 school calendar year.

# Structure:

First I want to identify 5-10 schools who are majority Black and 5-10 schools who are majority white in Allegheny County, Pittsburgh PA. I will start with 5 and if that is not enough data I will add more schools.
The story would begin with the different demographics of the school districts I use. I would like to start by asking a question such as “ Are Pittsburgh Schools Segregated?”or “ How does the segregation of Pittsburgh Schools affect the outcomes of involvement of local law enforcement?” (I’m still workshopping this).  As per the advice of the Good Charts Book I will deconstruct and reconstruct the charts I want to show to tell the story. First I will show the demographics of the different School Districts I choose. I will do this to make sure that people understand that I am trying to compare these schools by Race.
Second I will tell the story of misconduct categories split in two different charts. One chart would represent the majority Black School District misconduct category and another chart would represent the majority White School District misconduct category. This deconstruction of the charts would help the audience understand the step by step process of the story. 
The book suggests telling a sequential visual story so I am thinking of using a White student and a Black student and telling their story as they go to their prospective schools to make the story more engaging and personal and develop a connection between the audience and the issue at hand.
Now I would like to show the result of misconduct per school district type. I want to show two charts. One chart outlining discipline by race for majority white schools and another showing discipline by race for majority black students.
The next two chart comparisons would show incidents involving local law enforcement. 
Then I would like to show this data adjusted to the demographic population of each school district. Here I am thinking of using animation to show the charts changing slowly as I adjust for population size. 
Finally I would like to put out a call to action to stop the involvement of local law enforcement and not have suspensions for non-violent misconducts. 


# The Data:

Link to the data source: https://www.safeschools.pa.gov/Main.aspx?App=6a935f44-7cbf-45e1-850b-e29b2f1ff17f&Menu=dbd39a1f-3319-4a75-8f69-d1166dba5d70&res&fbclid=IwAR1kx--H7314n0PXinV5g3HMR8-R9zcV4mPl7i8UfeijKKRg5E5weK7Khc0

My data source is the Pennsylvania Safe Schools Department of Education Reports. The reports include reports by county, public school/district, charter, intermediate unit, vo-tech, non-public and by year. I will use the public school/district report. I will choose the top 5 schools who are majority white and the top 5 schools that are majority Black. When analyzing each school I will be looking at data on enrollment, misconduct categories, total arrests, offenders by race, and incidents involving local law enforcement. I am thinking of aggregating the misconduct categories between violent and non-violent or use a hierarchical method of aggregating it. 

# Method and Medium:

I will use a combination of Canva, tableau and personal digital illustrations to build my story. I am thinking of using Canva for the structure and color palettes. I will use tableau to build the basic charts and my personal illustrations to create figures of people and drawings as needed. I want to create vector figures of people to make it more personal. I might actually create an ArcGIS map to illustrate some location based data. For example to show how schools are still segregated.

# User Research Protocol:
The target audience I hope to reach with my story are people who can lobby their representatives to end over-suspensions and expulsions of Black students for non-violent crimes. For my interviews I decided to interview two people who are heavily involved with organizations that work on this issue, two people who don't have much knowledge on the issue and are not from or live in Pittsburgh to see if I can connect to them. One person who is knowledgable about chart making. One person who has gone through Allegheny County school system. 


## Intended Audience

When I first started doing this project I wanted to do it solely on arrest data by race and the presence of local law enforcement so it was a bit more detailed than the outcome. Therefore, my audience was going to be policy makers and school officials that are working on police reform at public schools. However, since the report on police presence and arrest data by race will not come out until later this year I decided to do it on expulsion and suspension rates by race. I started talking to someone that works at Pittsburgh Public schools in addition to a student that works with the Data for Black Lives chapter at CMU. We will be presenting this data to a group of higher education professionals in Pittsburgh next week. We will also be presenting this at a school’s equity coalition meeting this month. 

After connecting and agreeing to speak at these meetings I wanted to create personas that allow for the main stakeholder, the student, to take charge of the narrative to make this a personalized experience. Therefore, I created my personas Alex, a student that goes to a predominantly white school and Samira, a student that goes to a predominantly Black school. I wanted to tell the story from the student’s perspective because often people in power such as policy makers and school administrators tend to forget that their policies and actions affect real students. In my experience as an educator at a school with only immigrants and refugees I saw a huge disconnect between the students' stories and needs and the policies and actions of administrators and policy makers. I hope for these personas to reflect the sad reality of Allegheny County Public High Schools. 

This project is not nearly finished. I plan on turning it into my GIS final project as I talked to professor Kurland about that. In addition, I will be partnering with students from Data for Black Lives to continue this work. I will create different personas that are based on students that attend these schools. I plan on interviewing a few students and sketch out whole new personas that reflect their true stories. It is very important for me to center their voices in this narrative. 

## Summary of work

As stated before this is not the intended project I was planning on doing. However, I am very happy with the choice I made as after talking to multiple people in the field I discovered that this has never been done before which was very shocking for me to hear. At first I talked to someone who has many years of experience working in advocacy for Pittsburgh Public schools. I wanted to focus on the High School population because that is what I am familiar with. However, in the future I plan on expanding this project to all students. I decided to expand my project to all of Allegheny County High Schools.

 I used the Safe School Reports and that is where I started running into problems with the data collection methods. I initially wanted to separate violent and non-violent offenses. However, as I was collecting that data in an excel sheet I discovered that many schools will have offenses such as Bullying, vandalism, assault etc. that would have about 1-3 offense counts  then at the very bottom there was a category titled “violation of school code of conduct” that at many schools would have about 50 counts. This was confusing because wouldn’t “bullying” overlap with “violation of school code of conduct”. Then I realized that they weren’t collecting their data carefully or consistently. 

I also ran into the problem of identifying “true violence” and what each school identified as violent vs. non-violent. For example, one school could identify vandalism as violent while another wouldn’t. After talking to someone at Data for Black Lives they suggested that after this class is done we can look through the school’s code of conduct or even call them to see how they collect their data and what they identify as violent or non-violent. From there I scrapped the violent/nonviolent part of my research for now. 

Now the focus has shifted into general offenses, suspension, expulsions and arrests. When collecting data for suspensions I ran into the problem that the way the schools were collecting the data was confusing because for example there would be 10 Black offenders but 15 counts of suspensions. The data did not identify how many kids were suspended twice or whether there is discrepancy. Expulsion was fine because one can only be expelled from school once. I wanted to make sure that offense counts per race are adjusted to the population size of offenders per race. 

At first I showed all expulsion data in a bar graph. One of the feedback I had and implemented that since only 8 out of the 41 high schools implemented expulsions in 2019 I should highlight these 8 schools because it is visually easier to read. I kept the general graph just for reference. For suspensions since I am using 41 schools it was hard to read the general graph so I decided to include top 5 predominantly Black/White schools for comparison to make it easier to read.

In order to tell the story I decided to give a little bit of background on inequities at U.S. public schools especially when it came to segregation and how segregation is still prominent through redlining. I couldn’t find anything specific on Allegheny County but there was a lot of documentation about Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh Public Schools that I plan on using in the future as I continue to work on this project.

One thing that stood out to me working on this project is how inadequately and inconsistently organizations and public schools collect data. I was also surprised to learn that this has not been done before which makes me think about why Heinz doesn't have a systems project on racial inequities in Pittsburgh Public Schools. It also makes me sad to look through our systems projects that are mostly not to benefit underprivileged communities in Pittsburgh. Definitely something I’ll be looking more into.
